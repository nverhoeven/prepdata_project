Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## read the data in to seperate df's
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## merge the data
## apply appropriate names
##Final merge of the three
## extract mean and std  values for activity and subject
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## descriptive names for activity, read the corresponding table and factorize it in merge after characterizing
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
## appropriate name variable names
## t = time: Acc = by Accelerometer, Gyro = Gyroscope, f = frequency, Mag = Magnitude
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
##From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
## subject as factor and create tidy set and write to txt
